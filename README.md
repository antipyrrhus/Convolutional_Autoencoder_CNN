# Convolutional_Autoencoder_CNN

Several different models of denoising autoencoders (input noisy image, output noise-reduced image) are built using the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architecture, and unlabeled training / testing is performed on each using the MNIST dataset loaded thru Keras / Tensorflow and the results are compared.

To run, open the .ipynb file thru iPython Notebook.
